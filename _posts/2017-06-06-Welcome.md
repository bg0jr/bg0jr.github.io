# How to become a value investor?

I don't know ... let's try to find it out.

Approximately 2 years back i discovered [BuffetBooks.com](http://buffettsbooks.com/). It is really a great introduction into investing
and especially value investing.

I watched all the videos, bought and red the two books and was highly motivated to turn the ideas presented into reality.

Being a software developer for quite some years I - of course - started [RaynMaker](https://github.com/bg0jr/RaynMaker) ;-)

Unfortunately I then got fully occupied by other activities that I didn't achieved much since than ...


... but now I am back !! :)


... so let me share my thoughts on value investing as a software developer ;-)
